### Project goal
The main goals of this projects are to find the top clubs in the football-market, those that moved the most money overall, those that generated the most profits, and those that have generated the most losses. In addition, an objective of this analysis is to analyze whether _communities_ exist among the clubs.
In the last phase, it was also analyzed the change over time of the various clubs, analyzing the variation in the importance of them in the network, thus perhaps being able to understand any failures of particular clubs.<br>
To achieve all these objectives, the appropriate graph algorithms were performed. <br>
